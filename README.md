The goal of this project is to interpret the signs of naruto from a database that contains images of people who make signs with their hands.
We take a minimum of 20 images for each sign, to have a diversity of data, and measure the quality of our processing.
Technologies that we will use:
we will use **Python** to process images and to create interfaces.

**Python** is a high level, easy to use language that offers efficient features for image processing and simple features for creating graphical interfaces.
